  How to play? 
    Move the gun platform to smash the bricks. You need to destroy all the bricks before they touch the ground. With X-axes you move the gun to the left or right. The gun is sticked to the bottom of the matrix. With Y-axes you change the type of the gun: one bullet or two bullets once. With the joystick button you put the game on pause and when the game is on pause by pressing the joystick button you resume to the game. The game has five or six levels and the dificulty increases with the level. Initially, you have 3 lives. Each level has a "bonus", it means if you end the level in a short time, you get an extra live and every second under optimum time means 10 points score. The game ends when you win all the levels or when you have no lives. If your score is one of the top 10, it will appear a box when you put your name and the score enter in the top 10 highscores board.
