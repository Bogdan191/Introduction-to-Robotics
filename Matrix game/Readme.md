      How to play?
         
        Move the gun platform to smash the bricks. You need to destroy all the bricks before they touch the ground. With X-axes you move the gun to the left or right. The gun is sticked to the bottom of the matrix and you shoot with Y-axes(moving up). With the joystick button you put the game on pause and when the game is on pause by pressing the joystick button you resume to the game. The game has for or five levels and the dificulty increases with the level. Initially, you have 3 lives. Each level has a "bonus", it means if you end the level in a short time, you get an extra live and every second under optimum time means 10 points score. The game ends when you win all the levels or when you have no lives. In case you win all the levels, the score is higher if you have lives left, 1 live left means 50 score points. If your score is one of the top 3, this is saved in EEPROM.
